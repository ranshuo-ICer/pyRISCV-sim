# pyRISC-V

## Introduction

This is a simple RISC-V simulator written in Python.

It can simulate RV32I instructions and load programs from binary files.

The code is based on the tutorial at [从零实现RISC-V模拟器](https://weijiew.github.io/everystep/crvemu/README).

The differences between this implementation and the tutorial are:

- The implementation uses Python 3.x instead of C++.
